    Zulip supports integration with Basecamp and can notify you of
    events in Basecamp.
</p>

<p>
    First, create the stream you'd like to use for Basecamp notifications,
    and subscribe all interested parties to this stream. We
    recommend the name <code>basecamp</code>.
</p>

<p><code>{{ external_api_uri_subdomain }}/v1/external/basecamp?api_key=abcdefgh&amp;stream=basecamp</code></p>

<p>
    where <code>api_key</code> is the API key of your Zulip bot,
    and <code>stream</code> is the stream name you want the
    notifications sent to.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
    Next, go to your project on Basecamp and choose <code>Set up webhooks</code>
    from the <code>Settings</code> menu that is located in top right corner.
